HOW TO USE THE PYTHON TOOL FOR CALCULATING LCA FROM MANURE:

	SHOULD AN ERROR OCCUR, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST THE FILEPATH TO THE DEFAULT CONFIG FILES
	THIS CAN BE DONE IN LINES 48 AND 49 OF HOME.PY

4. OPEN THE LINK SHOWN IN YOUR TERMINAL IN YOUR BROWSER, IT SHOULD BE: http://127.0.0.1:8050/

5. FIRST GO TO INPUT DATA AND PUT IN YOUR FARM DATA. YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD EVERY FARM FILE SEPERATELY.
	FOR NOW, THERE IS A BUG, THAT PREVENTS THE DROPDOWN MENU FOR MANURE TYPE TO WORK CORRECTLY.

	0 FOR ONLY LIQUID, 1 FOR MIXED AND 2 FOR ONLY SOLID
	ALL ENTRIES INTO THE TABLE HAVE TO BE CONFIRMED BY PRESSING THE ENTER KEY
