# LCIA_from_manure

HOW TO USE THE PYTHON TOOL FOR CALCULATING LCA FROM MANURE:

1. SETUP PYTHON ENVIRONMENT. PYTHON 3.10 AND PYTHON 3.9 SHOULD BOTH WORK.

2. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL THE FOLLOWING PYTHON PACKAGES ON THE ENVIRONMENT:
	- FLASK
	- DASH
	- DASH-BOOTSTRAP-COMPONENTS
	- PANDAS
	- PLOTLY

3. RUN THE HOME.PY FILE.
	SHOULD AN ERROR OCCUR, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO ADJUST THE FILEPATH TO THE DEFAULT CONFIG FILES
	THIS CAN BE DONE IN LINES 48 AND 49 OF HOME.PY

4. OPEN THE LINK SHOWN IN YOUR TERMINAL IN YOUR BROWSER, IT SHOULD BE: http://127.0.0.1:8050/

5. FIRST GO TO INPUT DATA AND PUT IN YOUR FARM DATA. YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD EVERY FARM FILE SEPERATELY.
	PLEASE MAKE SURE TO FILL OUT ALL UNCERTAINTY PARAMETERS (MIN, MAX, EXPECTED VALUE) AS OTHERWISE THE LCA CALCULATION MIGHT NOT WORK
	ENTRIES INTO THE TABLE MAY NEED TO BE CONFIRMED BY PRESSING THE ENTER KEY

6. TO CALCULATE THE LCA, PLEASE SAVE THE FARM FILES DOWNLOADED IN TO THE "FARM FILES" FOLDER.

7. USE THE UNCERTAINTIES.PY SCRIPT TO RUN THE LCA. PLEASE ADJUST THE NUMBER OF SIMULATION RUNS TO YOUR NEEDS.

8. IF YOU WANT TO RUN A NEW SIMULATION, PLEASE REMOVE THE SIMULATION_RESULTS.H5 FILE FROM THE MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION FOLDER. IF YOU DON'T, CALCULATING A NEW SIMULATION WILL BE SKIPPED AND ONLY THE VISUALIZATION WILL BE RUN.
